# Process synchronization

- A cooperating process is one that can be affect or be affected by other process.

- Cooperating processes can either
  
  - directly share a logical address space ie both code and data
  
  - be allowed to share data only through files and messages

### The problem

Concurrent access to shared data may result in data inconsistency

### The solution

Using process synchronization, we discuss various mechanisms to ensure the ordely execution of cooperating processes that share a logical address space, so that data consistency is maintained.

## Producer-Consumer problem

\*P = Producer

\*C = Consumer

### The problem

A P process produces information that is consumed by the C.

### The solution

- One solution is to use shared memory.

- To allow P and C processes to run concurrently, we must have available a buffer of items that can be filled by the P and emptied by the C.

- This buffer will reside in a region of memory that is shared by both P and C processes.

- P can produce one item and keep it in the buffer, while the C is consuming another item.

- Both processes should be synchronized so that the consumer does not try to consume an item that has not yet been produced.

### Types of buffers

1. Unbouded buffer
   
   - No practical limit on the size of the buffer.
   
   - The C may have to wait for new items, but the P can always produce new items.

2. Bounded buffer
   
   - Assumed a fixed buffer size.
   
   - C must wait if buffer is empty, and P must wait if buffer is full.

### Implementation & issue

- To solve P-C problem, bounded buffer is implemented with some modifications.

- To keep track whether the buffer is full or not, say we use a variable `counter`.

- Counter is initialized to 0 `counter=0`.

- Counter is incremented when new item is added to the buffer `counter++`

- Counter is decremented when item is removed from the buffer `counter--`.

- We arrive at an incorrect state if both processes are allowed to manipulate the variable counter concurrently ie execute `counter++` and `counter--` at the same time.

### Race condition

A situation where several processes access and manipulate the same data concurrently and the outcome of the execution depends on the order in which the access takes place.

# Critical-Section problem

## Critical section

- Each process has a segment of code called a CS.

- In this section, the process may be changing variables that are shared between processes.

- We make sure that when one process is executing its CS, no other process is allowed to execute in their CS.

- Ie no two processes can execute their CSs at the same time.

- The CS problem is to design a protocol that the processes can use to cooperate.

```c
// A typical process block

do{
    // ENTRY SECTION
    // CRITICAL SECTION
    // EXIT SECTION
    // REMAINDER SECTION
} while(true);
```

## Requirements for solution to CS problem

1. Mutual exclusion
   
   - If a process is executing in its CS, no other process should be allowed to execute their CS.

2. Progress
   
   - If no process is executing their CS and some process wish to enter their CS, then onl process that are not executing their remainder sections can participate in the decision on which process will enter its CS next.

3. Bounded waiting
   
   - There should be a limit on the number of times other processes are allowed to enter their CS after a process has made a request to enter its critical section and before that request is granted.

# Peterson's solution

- A classic software-based solution to the CS problem.

- May not work correctly on modern computer architectures.

- However, it provides a good algorithmetic description of solving the CS problem and illustrates some of the complwxities involved in designing software that addresses the requirements of mutual exclusion, progress and bounded waiting.

## Implementation

- PS is restricted to 2 processes that alternate execution between their CS and remainder sections.

- Call them processes `Pi` and `Pj`

- PS requires two data items to be shared between two processes:
  
  - `int turn`: Indicates whose turn it is to enter its CS.
  
  - `boolean flag[2]`: Indicates it a process is ready to enter its CS.

- When `Pi` wants to enter its CS, it will set `flag[i]=true`, indicating that `Pi` is ready to enter its CS.

- When `Pi` want to enter its CS, it will set `turn=j`, the other process.

```c
// Structure of process Pi in PS

do{
    flag[i]=true;
    turn=j;
    while( flag[j] && turn==j );
    // CRITICAL SECTION
    flag[i]=false;
    // REMAINDER SECTION
}while(true);
```

```c
// Structure of process Pj in PS

do{
    flag[j]=true;
    turn=i;
    while( flag[i] && turn==i );
    // CRITICAL SECTION
    flag[j]=false;
    // REMAINDER SECTION
}while(true);
```

Satisfies all three requirements for solution of CS problem.

# Test & Set Lock

- A hardware solution to the process synchronization problem.

- There is a shared lock variables which can be 0 or 1.

- 0 means unlocked, 1 means locked.

- Before entering into CS, the process inquires about the lock.

- If it locked, it keep waiting till it becomes free.

- If it is not locked, the process locks it and executes its CS.

```c
boolean testAndSet(boolean *target){
    boolean rv = *target;
    *target = true;
    return rv;
}
```

```c
// Process P1 wants to enter its CS

do{
    while(testAndSet(&lock)); // do nothing
    // Critical section
    lock = false;
    // remainder section
}while(true);
```

Satisfies all requirements 1&2 for solution of CS problem, but fails bounded-waiting.

# Semaphores

- Software based solution.

- A technique to manage concurrent processes by using a single integer value called a semaphore.

- Semaphore is a non-negative variable that is shared between threads.

- A semaphore S, apart from initialization is accessed only throught two stand atomic operations `wait()` and `signal()`.

- `wait()`: Denoted by letter P: proberen - test in Dutch

- `signal()`: Denoted by letter V: verhogen - increment in Dutch

```c
// Definition of wait()

P (Semaphore S) {
    while(S<=0); //no operation
    S--;
    // Critical section
}
```

```c
// Definition of singal()

V (Semaphore S) {
    S++;
}
```

## Types of Semaphores

1. Binary semaphore
   
   - Value can be 0 or 1.
   
   - On some systems, these are known as mutex locks, as they are locks that provide mutual exclusion.

2. Counting semaphore
   
   - Value range is unrestricted.
   
   - It is used to controll access to a resource that has multiple instances.

## Disads

### Requires busy waiting.

- While a process is in its CS, other processes must loop continously in the entry code.

- Busy waiting wastes CPU cycles that some other process might be able to use productively.

- This type of semaphore is called spinlock cus the process spins while waiting for lock.

### Solution

- To overcome the need for busy waiting, we can modify the defination of `wait()` and `signal()` semaphore operations.

- Rather than engaging in busy waiting, the process can block itself.

- The block operation places a process into a waiting queue associated with the semaphore, and the state if the process is switched to the waiting state.

- Then contol is transferref to the CPU scheduler, which selects another process to execute.

### Deadlocks and starvation

- The implementation of a semaphore with a waiting indefinately for an event that can be caused only by one of the waiting processes.

- The event is question is the execution of `signal()` operation. When such a state is reached, these processes are said to be deadlocked.

```c
// Deadlocked processes


P0                    P1
wait(S);              wait(Q);
wait(Q);              wait(S);
..                    ..
..                    ..
signal(S);            signal(Q);
signal(Q);            signal(S);
```

# Bounded-Buffer problem

- Also called Producer-Consumer problem.

- There is a buffer of n slots and each slot is capable of storing one unit of data.

- There are two processes P and C which are operating on the buffer.

## Implementation

- Consider a buffer of n slots.

- P produces data and stores to the buffer.

- C consumes data from the buffer.

- P tries to insert data into empty slots of the buffer.

- C tries to remove data from a filled slot of the buffer.

- P must not insert data when buffer is full.

- C must not remove data when buffer is empty.

- P and C should not insert/remove data simultaneously.

## Solution

- We require three semaphores.
  
  1. **mutex**: A binary semaphore which is used to acquire and release the lock.
  
  2. **empty**: A counting semaphore whose initial value is the number of slots in the buffer.
  
  3. **full**: A counting semaphore with initial value 0.

```c
// Producer

do{
    wait(empty); // wait until empty>0, then empty--
    wait(mutex); // acquire lock
    // add data to buffer
    signal(mutex); // release lock
    signal(full); // increment full
}while(true);
```

```c
// Consumer

do{
    wait(full); // wait until full>0, then full--
    wait(mutex); // acquire lock
    // remove data to buffer
    signal(mutex); // release lock
    signal(full); // increment empty
}while(true);
```

# Reader-Writers problem

- A database is to be shared among several concurrent processes.

- There can be two types of processes:
  
  - Readers: Want to read the DB.
  
  - Writers: Want to read+write the DB.

- If two readers access, then no problem.

- If a writer and another thread (writer or reader) access, then causes issues.

- To ensure that this doesn't happen, we require that writers have exclusive access to the shared DB.

\*R = reader

\*W = writer

## Solution using Semaphores

- Use two semaphores and one integer.
  
  - **mutex**: A semaphore initialized to 1, ensures mutual exclusion
  
  - **wrt**: Another semaphore initialized to 1, common to R and W
  
  - **readcount**: An integer variable initialised to 0, that keeps track of how many processes are currently reading the object

```c
// Writer process

do{
    // Writer requests for CS
    wait(wrt);
    // Performs the write
    // Leaves the CS
    singal(wrt);
}while(true);
```

```c
// Reader process

do{
    wait(mutex); // Number of Rs incremented
    readcount++;
    if(readcount==1)
        wait(wrt); // No W can enter if reader there
    signal(mutex); // Other Rs can enter while this R is in CS
    // Current reader performs read
    wait(mutex);
    readcount--; // A R wants to leave
    if(readcount==0) // No R is left in the CS
        signal(wrt); // Ws can enter
    signal(mutex); // R leaves
}while(true);
```

# Dining Philosophers problem

![](/images/2022-01-30-20-24-24-image.png)

- A philoser can either think or eat.

- When one thinks, he cannot interact with others.

- When one gets hungry, he tries to pick up two adjacent forks.

- One cannot pick up a fork that is already in the hand of the neighbour.

- Once he starts to eat, he doesn't release his forks. When he has finished, he puts down both forks and starts thinking again.

## Solution

- One simple solution is to represent each frok with a semaphore.

- A philosopher tries to grab a fork by executing a `wait()` operation on that semaphore.

- He releases his fork by executing `signal()` operation on that particular semaphore.

- Thus the shared data is `Semaphore chopstick[5]` with all initilized to 1.

```c
// Structure of philosopher i
do{
    wait(chopstick[i]);
    wait(chopstick[(i+1)%5]);
    ...
    // eat
    signal(chopstick[i]);
    signal(chopstick[(i+1)%5]);
    // think
}while(true);
```

## Deadlock

- Although this solution guarantees that no two neighbours are eating simultaneously, it could still create a deadlock.

- Suppose that all five become hungry and each grab their left chopstick.

- When each tries to grab his right chopstick, he will be delayed forever.

## Deadlock avoidance

- Allow at most four to be sitting at the table.

- Allow one to to pick up this chopsticks only if both are available. Pick up will have to be done in CS.

- Asymmetric solution: An odd person picks up first his left chopstick and then right. Even, right, left.
