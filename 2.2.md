# Deadlocks

- In a multiprogramming environment, several processes may compete for a finite no of resources.
- A process requests resources, and if the resources are not available at that time, the process enters a waiting state.
- Sometimes, a waiting process is never again able to change state because the resources it has requested are held by other processes.

## System model

- A system consists of a finite no of resources to be distributed among a no of competing processes.
- The resources are partitioned into several types, each consisting of some no of identical instances.
- Examples of resources:
  - Memory space
  - CPU cycles
  - Files
  - IO devices

A process may utilize a resource in only the following sequence:

1. **Request**: The process requests the resource. If the request
   cannot be granted immediately (for example, if the resource is
   being used by another process), then the requesting process
   must wait until it can acquire the resource.
2. **Use**: The process can operate on the resource (for example, if
   the resource is a printer, the process can print on the printer).
3. **Release**: The process releases the resource.

## Deadlock characterization

Following four conditions should hold simultaneously for a deadlock to occur:

1. **Mutual exclusion**
   - At least one resource must be held in a non-shareable
     mode; i.e only one process at a time can use a resource.
   - If another process requests that resource, the requesting process must be delayed until the resource has been released.
2. **Hold and wait**:
   - A process holding at least one resource is waiting to acquire additional resources held by other processes
3. **No preemption**:
   - A resource can be released only voluntarily by the process holding it, after that process has completed its task.
   - Resource can not be preempted.
4. **Circular wait**:
   - There exists a set {P0, P1, …, Pn} of waiting processes such that P0 is waiting for a resource that is held by P1, P1 is waiting for a resource that is held by P2, …, Pn–1 is waiting for a resource that is held by Pn, and Pn is waiting for a resource that is held by P0.

## Resource allocation graph

- Deadlocks can be described more precisely in terms of a directed graph called a system resource allocation graph.
- This graphs consists of set of vertices V and set of edges E.
- The set V is partitioned into two different types of nodes:
  - P = {P<sub>1</sub>, .. P<sub>n</sub> } ie the set of active processes.
  - R = {R<sub>1</sub>, .. R<sub>m</sub> } ie the set of resource types.
- Edges are of two types
  - **Request edge**
    P<sub>i</sub> => R<sub>j</sub> signifies that process P<sub>i</sub> has requested an instance of resource R<sub>j</sub>, and is currently waiting for that resource.
  - **Assignment edge**
    R<sub>j</sub> => P<sub>i</sub> signifies that an instance of resource type R<sub>j</sub> has been allocated to process P<sub>i</sub>.

## Drawing graphs

![](/images/2022-01-31-23-22-57-image.png)

- **Circle**: A process
- **Rectangle with 3 dots**: A resource with 3 instances

![](/images/2022-01-31-23-29-56-image.png)

- P = { P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, P<sub>3</sub> }
- R = { R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub>, R<sub>4</sub> }
- £ = { P<sub>1</sub>=>R<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>=>R<sub>3</sub>, R<sub>1</sub>=>P<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>=>P<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>=>P<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>3</sub>=>P<sub>3</sub> }
- - 1 instance of R<sub>1</sub>
  - 2 instance of R<sub>2</sub>
  - 1 instance of R<sub>3</sub>
  - 3 instance of R<sub>4</sub>

- If the graph contains no cycles, then there is no deadlock.
- But if the graph contains a cycle, there MAY exist a deadlock.
- If there is a cycle and the resources have just one instance, then deadlock exists.

## Methods for handling deadlock

1. We can use a protocol to prevent or avoid deadlocks, ensuring that the system will never a deadlock state.
   - To ensure deadlocks never occur, the system can use either a **deadlock prevention** or **deadlock avoidance** scheme
2. We can allow the system to enter a deadlock state, detect it and recover.
   - In this environment, the system can provide an algo that examines the state of the system to determine deadlock has occurred and an algo to recover from deadlock.
3. We can ignore that problem altogether and pretend that deadlocks never occur in the system.
   - If a system neither prevents deadlocks, nor provides for deadlock detection and recovery, then we may arrive at a situation where the system is in a deadlocked state yet has no way of recognizing what has happened.
   - In this case, the deadlock will lead to deterioration of the system's performance, because resources are being held by processes that cannot run and because more and more processes, as they make requests for resources, will enter a deadlocked state.
   - Eventually, the system will stop functioning and will need to be restarted manually.

## Deadlock prevention

For a deadlock to occur, each of the four necessary condition must hold true:
1. Mutual exclusion
2. Hold and wait
3. No preemption
4. Circular wait
By ensuring that at least one of these conditions cannot hold, we can prevent the occurrence of a deadlock.

### Preventing the conditions

1. Mutual exclusion
   - A printer cannot be simultaneously shared by several processes, while a read-only file can be.
   - In general, we cannot prevent deadlocks by denying ME condition, because some resources are intrinsically non-sharable.

2. Hold and wait
   - Whenever a process requests a resource, it should not hold an other resources.
   - One protocol is that each process to request and be allocated all its resources before it begins execution.
   - Another protocol is allows a process to request resources only when it has none. Before the process can request any other additional resources, it must release all the resources that it is currently allocated.
   - Both these protocols have two main disadvantages
     - Resource utilization may be low.
     - Starvation is possible.

3. No preemption
   - We can use the following protocol. If a process is holding some resources and requests another resource that cannot be immediately allocated to it, then all resources currently being held are preempted.
   - Another protocol is if a process requests some resources, we check if they are available, if yes, then allocate them. If not, we check whether they are allocated to some other process that is waiting for additional resources. If so, we preempt the desired resources from the waiting process and allocate them to the requesting process.
   - This protocol can be applied to resources whose state can be saved and restored later, such as CPU and registers, not to resources like printers.

4. Circular wait
   - To ensure this condition never holds is to impose a total ordering of all resource types and to require that each process requests resources in an increasing order of enumeration.
   - P<sub>1</sub> if requests R<sub>2</sub>, cannot request for R<sub>1</sub>. It can only request for resources greater than R<sub>2</sub> like to R<sub>3</sub>, R<sub>4</sub>, etc.
   - Just by numbering resources does not prevent deadlock. It is up to application devs to write programs that follow the ordering.

## Deadlock avoidance

- An alternative method for avoiding deadlocks is to require additional information about how to resources are to be requested.
- With the knowledge of the sequence of requests and releases for each process, the system can decide for each request whether of not the process should wait in order to avoid a possible future deadlock.
- Each request requires that in making this decision the system consider the resources currently available, the resources currently allocated to each process, and the future requests and releases of each process.

### Safe state

- A state is safe if the system can allocate resources to each process (up to its maximum) in some order and still avoid a deadlock.
- A system is in a safe state only if there exists a safe sequence. A sequence of processes < P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, P<sub>n</sub> > is a safe sequence for the current allocation state if, for each process, the resource that it requests can still be satisfied by the currently available resources plus the resources held by all processes.
- A safe state is not a deadlocked state. A deadlocked state is an unsafe state. Not all unsafe states are deadlocks.
- An unsafe state may lead to a deadlock. As long as the state is safe, the OS can avoid unsafe (and deadlocked) states. In an unsafe state, the OS cannot prevent processes from requesting such that a deadlock occurs: The behavior of the processes controls unsafe states.

![](/images/2022-02-07-15-59-57-image.png)

Consider a system with 12 magnetic tape drives and 3 process:

|               | Maximum Needs | Current Needs |
| :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: |
| P<sub>0</sub> |      10       |       5       |
| P<sub>1</sub> |       4       |       2       |
| P<sub>2</sub> |       9       |       2       |

At time t<sub>0</sub>, the system is in a safe state. The sequence < P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>0</sub>, P<sub>2</sub> > satisfies the safety condition.
A system can go from a safe state to an unsafe state.
Suppose at time t<sub>1</sub>, process P<sub>2</sub> requests and is allocated one more tape drive. Then the system is no longer in a safe state.

## Resource allocation graph algo

In the resource allocation graph, we learnt the request and assignment edges. Now we introduce a new type of edge called the claim edge, represented by a dashed line.
A claim edge P<sub>i</sub> -> R<sub>j</sub> indicates that process P<sub>i</sub> may request resource R<sub>j</sub> at some time in the future.

![](/images/2022-02-07-20-40-10-image.png)

When P<sub>1</sub> requests R<sub>2</sub>, the claim edge P<sub>1</sub>->R<sub>2</sub> is converted to a request edge. Similarly, when R<sub>2</sub> is releases by P<sub>1</sub>, the assignment edge R<sub>2</sub>->P<sub>1</sub> is reconverted to a claim edge P<sub>1</sub>->R<sub>2</sub>

The resources must be claimed a priori in the system. Ie before process P<sub>i</sub> starts executing, all its claim edges must already appear in the resource allocation graph.

Suppose that P<sub>i</sub> requests R<sub>j</sub>. The request can be granted only if converting the request edge P<sub>i</sub>->R<sub>j</sub> to and assignment edge R<sub>j</sub>->P<sub>i</sub> does not result in the formation of a cycle in the resource allocation graph.

Note that we check for safety by using a cycle-detection algo.

If no cycle exist, then the allocation of resource will leave the system in a safe state.

If a cycle is found, then the allocation will put the system in an unsafe state.

## Banker's Algo

Resource allocation graph algo can be only used when each resource has only one instance. Banker's algo is used in resource allocation systems with multiple instances of each resource type.

It given the name because the algo could be used in a banking system to ensure that the bank never allocated its available cash in such a way that it could no longer satisfy the needs of all its customers.

### Implementation

Let `n` be the number of processes in the system and `m` be the number of resource types.

1. Available:
   - 1D array of size `m`, indicating the number of available resources. `int available[m];`
   - `available[j] = k;` means that there are `k` instances of resource type R<sub>j</sub>.

2. Max:
   - 2D array of size `n x m`, that specifies the maximum demand of each process in a system. `int max[n][m];`
   - `max[i][j] = k` means that P<sub>i</sub> may request `k` instances of resource type R<sub>j</sub>.

3. Allocation:
   - 2D array of size `n x m`, that specifies the number of resources of each type currently allocated to each process. `int allocation[n][m];`
   - `allocation[i][j] = k` means that P<sub>i</sub> is currently allocated `k` instances of resource type R<sub>j</sub>.

4. Need:
   - 2D array of size `n x m`, that indicates the remaining resource needs of each process. `int need[n][m];`
   - `need[i][j] = k` means that P<sub>i</sub> currently needs `k` instances of resource type R<sub>j</sub> for its execution.
   - `need[i][j] = max[i][j] - allocation[i][j]`

### Safety algo

- Indicates that the system will be in a safe state or not.

1. Let work and finish be vectors of length and m and n.
   Initialize:
   work = available
   finish[i] = false

2. Finish an i such that both
   finish[i] = false
   need<sub>i</sub> <= work
   If no such i exists, go to step 4

3. work = work + allocation[i]
   finish[i] = true
   go to step 2

4. If finish[i] = true for all i
   then the system is in a safe state.

## Resource-request algo

- Used when a process is going to request for a resource.

1. If request<sub>i</sub> <= need<sub>i</sub>, go to step 2
   Otherwise raise an error since the process has exceeded its maximum claim.

2. If request<sub>i</sub> <= available, go to step 3
   Otherwise P<sub>i</sub> must wait, since the resources are not available.

3. Have the system pretend to have allocated the requested resources to process P<sub>i</sub> by modifying the states as follows:
   available = available - request<sub>i</sub>
   allocation<sub>i</sub> = allocation<sub>i</sub> + request<sub>i</sub>
   need<sub>i</sub> = need<sub>i</sub> - request<sub>i</sub>

## Deadlock detection

### Single instance of each resource type

- In systems where each resource has only a single instance, we can use Wait-for graph, which is an algo for deadlock detection and is a variant of resource allocation graph.
- We obtains this graph from the resource allocation graph by removing the resource nodes and collapsing the appropriate edges.
- An edge from P<sub>i</sub> to P<sub>j</sub> indicates that P<sub>i</sub> is waiting for P<sub>j</sub> to release a resource that is needed by P<sub>i</sub>.

### Multiple instance of each resource type

This algo employs several time-varying data structures similar to those used in Banker's algo, which are:

1. Available
   1D array of length `m` indicates the number of available resources of each type.

2. Allocation
   2D array of size `n x m` defines the number of resources of each type currently allocated to each process.

3. Request
   2D array of size `n x m` which indicates the current request of each process.
   If `request[i][j] = k`, then P<sub>i</sub> is requesting `k` more instances of resource type R<sub>j</sub>.

#### Implementation

1. Declare:

   ```c
   int work[m];
   int finish[n];
   ```

   Initialize:

   ```c
   work = available;
   for (int i=0; i<n-1; i++)
       if (allocation[i] != 0)
           finish[i] = false;
       else finish[i] = true;
   ```

2. Find an `i` such that both
   `finish[i]==false && request[i] <= work`
   if no such `i` exists, then go to step 4

3. `work = work + allocation[i]`
   `finish[i] = true`

4. If `finish[i] = false` for some `i`, then the system is in deadlock.

## Recovery from deadlock

What to do when a deadlock detection algo determines that a deadlock exists? Following possibilities:
1. Inform the user that a deadlock has occurred and let him deal with it manually.
2. Let the system recover from deadlock automatically.
However, the first one is called be done.
How to break the deadlock?
1. Abort one or more processes to break the circular wait.
2. Preempt some resources from one or more of the deadlocked processes.

### Process abortion/termination

#### How to break processes by aborting?

1. Abort all deadlocked processes
   - Deadlock cycles will be broken at a great expense. The computations done by these processes will discarded and will have to be recomputed later.
2. Abort one process at a time, until deadlock cycle is eliminated
   - Incurs overhead, since after each process is aborted, a deadlock detection algo must be invoked to determine whether any other processes are still deadlocked.

#### Aborting a process may not be easy

- If the process was updating a file, terminating it will leave that file in an incorrect state.
- If the process was printing using a printer, the system must reset the printer to a correct state before printing the next job.

#### If one-by-one type of abortion is used:

- We must determine which process should be aborted. The order of abortion.
- This determination is a policy decision, similar to CPU scheduling decisions.
- We should abort the process whose termination will incur the minimum cost.

#### Factors that affect order of process abortion

- Priority of the process.
- How long process has computed and how much longer the process will compute before completing.
- How many and what type of resources that process has used, whether that resource is simple to preempt.
- How many more resources the process needs in order to complete.
- How man processes will need to be terminated.
- Whether the process is interactive or batch.

### Resource preemption

- Here we successively preempt some resources from processes and give these resources to other processes until the deadlock cycle is broken.
- If preemption is required to deal with deadlocks, then there issues need to be addresses:
  1. Selecting a victim
  2. Rollback
  3. Starvation

#### Selecting a victim

- Selecting which resource is not be preempted.
- Determining the order of preemption to minimize cost.
- Cost means parameters such as the number of resources a deadlocked process is holding, and the amount of time it has so far consumed during its execution.

#### Rollback

- What do we do with a process if we preempt its resources?
- It cannot continue its normal execution as its missing some or all its needed resources.
- We must rollback the process to some safe state and restart it from that state.
- But what is a safe state? It is difficult what a safe state is, so the simplest solution is a total rollback, since computation will be needed to find the safe state.
- Total rollback is to abort the process and restart it, which is almost similar to process abortion.

#### Starvation

- How do we ensure that starvation will not occur?
- How do we guarantee that resources will not always be preempted from the same process?
- If victim selection is based primarily on cost factors, it may happen that the same process is picked as a victim. As a result, this process never completes its designated task.
- We must ensure that a process can be picked as victim only a small, finite number of times.
- So we have to include the number of rollbacks in the cost factor.
